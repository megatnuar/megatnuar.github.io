I've been interested in computers and coding since before I was in my first programming class in university. I wrote down a lot of ideas which would turn into potential projects had I put more effort into doing it. I've played a bit with RaspberryPis and microcontrollers, built a secondary pc with Linux as an operating system. But I never really put my ideas and projects out there. So welcome I guess.

# 🎓📜 Education
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). In my third year, I took computational physics classes as part of my undergrad's concentration. I did my undergraduate thesis in the field of quantum information where I studied the interaction between a qubit and a spin coherent state varying in their dipole-interaction strength visualised in the Majorana representation.

# 😸 Now
Currently I am taking Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course and intend to get a career in cybersecurity. I've been interested in SOC analysts roles.

I plan to publish more stuff here.
